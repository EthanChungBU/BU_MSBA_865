# HCI Gesture Recognition

## Description
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook detailing the development and implementation of a gesture recognition system for human-computer interaction (HCI). This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to interpret human gestures as inputs for computer systems, enhancing the user interface and experience.

## Project Structure
- **Gesture_Recognition_for_Human_Computer_Interaction.ipynb**: The main notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and the evaluation of different machine learning techniques used for gesture recognition.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the deep learning framework used)
